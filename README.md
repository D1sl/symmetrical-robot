# Sour Screens
## Description
________________
This application allows users to search for specific actors or actresses by name and receive their worst rated movies. It uses The Movie Databse server-side API to seach for the actors using unique actor ids. By getting this id we were able to then access all the information we needed on that actor and display it in another page. This information includes their profile picture, a small biography, and a list of movies that starts with those that are rated worst to best.

On the landing page users are also able to choose a genre from a dropdown menu, which will result in the appearance of the title, poster, rating, and review of the worst movie in that category over the past year.

Lastly, we've incorporated fun Star Wars quotes onto the landing page for fun.
